# Location

The wedding will be at point lookout community hall on stradbroke island.

## Things to do

There are a few cool things to do on the island, although mostly its just good hanging out on the beach reading and going for swims, since its pretty much a tropical island.

## Scuba diving

You can go diving with the scuba people who are at the hostel down the road. The diving is pretty good and you can see leopard sharks and manta rays. The diving trips leave twice a day.

## Beach

Home beach where were staying is a several kilometer long ocean beach which is safe for swimming and is a nice warm temperature for swimming. Since its the east coast you can even watch the sun come up.

## Straddie pub

There's a nice pub within walking distance of the accommodation, it also has a bottle shop if you want to have a few quiet beers on the beach.
