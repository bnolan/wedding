# Location

Point Lookout is a small coastal holiday town located on [North Stradbroke Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Stradbroke_Island), affectionately known as "Straddie". The permanent population on the island is probably less than 2000, but swells significantly during the holidays, and is a popular destination for Brisbane residents over summer.

## Why Straddie?

Rissa first took Ben to Straddie with her family about year after they got together. It was a short visit, but they went 4WDing on Main Beach, dug [eugarie](http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find+out+about/Animals+of+Queensland/Molluscs/Bivalves/Eugarie#.VGMp90s_cy4) out the sand, pulled [worms](http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/375856/Beachworms.pdf) for bait but didn't catch any legal size fish. They saw humpback whales & Ben got a little insight into the life Rissa lived while growing up on the neighbouring [Moreton Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Island).

Since then, Ben & Rissa have escaped to Straddie a few more times, and when they got engaged, they already had a short trip planned. Ben suggested they investigate having the wedding on the island, and Rissa agreed - more practical than Moreton Island, not far for Rissa's dad to travel to, and still beautiful, unique and relaxing place - somewhere special they wanted to share, somewhere memorable.

## What to expect

While it can be chaotic over summer holidays, by February all the children will have gone back to school and most holiday makers will be back at work.

Pt Lookout is a chilled out, coastal town. It has one pub (with an attached bottle shop), a small Four Square Supermarket, two fish & chip shops, a few cafes, and fantastic beaches.

Wellington visitors especially will notice that the coffee & beer selection isn't great, WiFi is virtually non-existent... in fact it can be pretty hard just to get a mobile phone signal at all in some places! But hopefully you can all cope for a day or two. :)

There are no two ways about it, February is going to be HOT. Not only that, it will probably be humid too. So make sure you've got your hat, sunscreen & sunnies packed. The water is potable on Straddie, which is lucky since you will want to drink a lot of it - just be considerate of any water restrictions & keep your showers short (or better yet, swim in the sea!)

You probably won't get bitten by a snake or eaten by a crocodile, but you will need insect repellant, especially early morning and late afternoon evening. Don't worry, if you're travelling light & can't bring any due to those pesky aviation regulations about flying with liquids, we will have some extras on hand to share.

# Things to do

As you can imagine with a coastal town, most activities revolve around the sea & the beach.

There are [five main beaches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Stradbroke_Island#Beaches) at Straddie. The beach we are getting married on is Home Beach, which is good for swimming (especially up the eastern end). The next beach along is Cylinder Beach, which is a lovely safe, patrolled beach, popular with families and close to the pub. Rissa's favourite thing to do is to spend a few hours exploring all the beaches, walking from Home Beach around the rocky outcrop to Cylinder then to Deadman's and Frenchman's, beachcombing & people watching. From here, it's a steep climb up the to the top of the headland, where you can get an ice cream or fish & chips, and enjoy a fine view of Main Beach down the island.

Up on top of the headland are where most of the shops are located, but it's also worth the trip for the [Gorge walk](http://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Attraction_Review-g1527215-d2446744-Reviews-North_Gorge_Walk-Point_Lookout_North_Stradbroke_Island_Redland_City_Greater_Bris.html). In the late afternoon, grey kangaroos can often be seen grazing in the reserve across the road.

Unfortunately February is out season for whale watching (generally runs from May - October). so you'll have to content yourselves with watching for kangaroos, koalas, the bird life (the dawn chorus is pretty impressive) and the odd dolphin. 

## Scuba diving

[Manta Lodge & SCUBA Centre](http://www.mantalodge.com.au) run daily trips (bookings recommended) out to the nearby reefs and bommies, and is great place to see manta rays, turtles, leopard sharks, and many sub tropical reef species. We've dived with them before and can recommend them. For those that don't dive, they also run snorkelling trips and can organise tours to the freshwater lakes and rent out fishing gear, surf boards, sand boards, sea kayaks etc.
