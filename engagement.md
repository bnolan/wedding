# Engagement

It was a super romantic trip to Adelaide, staying above a craft beer pub in some super nice rooms, and Ben had the ring hidden in his backpack.

# Friday the 13th

Ben really wanted to go to the beach and propose on Friday the 13th, but at the last moment, he got nervous and decided not to tempt fate and bad luck. Rissa couldn't understand why Ben kept asking to go to the beach for a swim on such a gloomy and cold day.... but then again, he had gone swimming before in colder weather, so it wasn't that unusual!

# A trip to the beach

So Ben and Rissa jumped on a tram to Glenelg beach on Saturday afternoon to go for a walk, and probably not a swim, since it was still cold. 

On the way to the beach, Ben didn't talk at all, because he was worried he'd give away his plan by saying something like "Don't you think beaches are romantic, do you think a beach would be a good location for a life event?". Instead he said nothing at all.

He also would not let Rissa get her tablet to read out of his bag. Rissa did not notice.

# Wet feet

Ben thought he'd found the perfect romantic spot on the nearly deserted beach. So as he clowned around, and was about to ask Rissa to close her eyes, when the waves came rolling in and poured water into his (only pair of) shoes. It was cold.

Ben then asked rissa to close her eyes while he rustled around in his bag and proposed with a gold wedding band.

## After party

We decided not to tell everyone (although ben did text sam "achievement unlocked") because we wanted to tell our friends in person instead of over the internet.

So instead...
