# Date

Save the **date**! Our wedding will now be on the 7th of February 2015. Which happens to be Waitangi weekend in New Zealand. So you should be able to take a lo-o-o-ng weekend on our favourite (sub)tropical island without taking too much time off work. :)

# The BIG Day

The ceremony will be around 3:30pm on Saturday the 7th of February. It will be held on Home Beach, Pt Lookout.&nbsp;

The reception will be held at the nearby Pt Lookout Community Hall. It will start from around dusk.

Both locations are a short walk from the recommended accommodation and each other, and directions/maps will be provided closer to the date.

**Dress code** is smart casual and footwear is optional during the ceremony (although you might want to wear something for the short walk to the reception). Note we will be on a sandy island, so choose your footwear wisely (stilettos at your own peril!).

Ultimately, we want you to be comfortable - it will be warm and humid - so leave the jeans, fur coats and legwarmers at home.

And **no gifts please** - no really! It may sound a bit sappy and cliched, but all we really want is for you to be there to share the day with us. :)


## The day after

We will have an informal gathering on the Sunday after, either at one of the accommodations or at the park next to Home Beach. Anyone who is able stay and join us is welcome. 

There will probably be some shrimps on the barbie, cold beverages and swims on the beach. Duncan should bring his cricket stuff.&nbsp;**Yay!**
