# Accomodation

Although Straddie isn't far from Brisbane, you will need to stay at least one night if you want to come & have a beer with us at the reception, as the ferries stop running back to the mainland about 7pm.

Some of you might like to get together with a few of our other guests and share accommodation for the weekend. Here are our recommendations - some places we have stayed at, others we have just looked up on the internet based on how convenient they are. If you're not sure about anything, or would like help booking accommodation or getting in touch with other guests, just let us know. :)

## The Allure

[The Allure](http://www.allurestradbroke.com.au/ ) doesn't have direct beach access, but it is only across the road! It is the closest accommodation the ceremony site & reception venue. The architecturally designed "beach shacks" & villas are well equipped, fully self-contained and have air conditioning. It also has on-site a pool, children's playground, shared edible garden and cafe. We stayed here in November and will probably book this for ourselves. (Tip: shacks/villas on the back row are the most private & peaceful).

We have registered our wedding with the Allure, so if quote our names & the wedding date you will recieve a 10% discount from their advertised rate.

These are the rates that have been provided to us (these include a 10% wedding discount):

## The Anchorage

[The Anchorage](http://stradbrokeresorts.com.au/) has a minimum of 2 night stay and is about 10 minutes walk to the ceremony and reception. Althought we haven't stayed here, we met the owners who were very helpful and showed us through the different accommodation options they have. All units are self contained and it has a fully fenced pool as well as direct access through the tea tree forest to the beach. You can even see the sea from some of the higher floors. The owners have let us know that the entire facility is booked out from Monday 9th February, so if you want to stay longer, we recommend booking elsewhere. Not all units have air conditioning either, so make sure you request it! See [the PDF](http://stradbrokeresorts.com.au/Library/PDF'S/TARIFFS%202014%20-%202015.pdf) for information on the accommodation type and rates for the Anchorage.

## Other options

The [Manta Lodge and Dive Centre](http://www.mantalodge.com.au/) is the only backpackers on the island, and we've stayed here a few times. It is short (10min) walk from the ceremony & reception locations, and we can definitely recommend it if you're on a budget. They are also the local dive operator if you want to see manta rays.

We have not investigated this place in person, but the [Islander Holiday Resort] (http://www.stradbrokeislander.com.au) is right next to the Allure, and seem to have good rates online, although TripAdvisor reviews suggest their accommodation is a little dated! Regardless, it is also very handy to the ceremony & reception locations, the beach, the pub, etc. 

If you're planning to stay for more than a few days, it might also be worth renting a holiday house (or bach, as they're called in New Zealand). This is how most visitors to the island would spend their summer holidays :)

Places to book holidays houses include: 
[Dolphin Property Management] (http://www.straddie.info)
[Stayz North Stradbroke Is] (http://www.stayz.com.au/accommodation/qld/queensland-islands/north-stradbroke-island)
[Stradbroke Holidays - Pt Lookout] (http://www.stradbrokeholidays.com.au/accommodation/?c=point-lookout)
[Ray White Stradbroke] (http://www.visitstradbroke.com.au)

... just make sure the place you book is close to Home Beach, Point Lookout (and definitely not in Amity Pt or Dunwich -  or else it's a long walk home and there are no taxis ;) )
