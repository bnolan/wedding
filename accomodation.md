# Accommodation

We recommend staying at either the Anchorage or the Allure. Both places are ~5-10min walk away from the ceremony & reception, as well as each other.

Some of you might like to get together with a few of the other guests and share accommodation for the weekend. If you're not sure about anything, or would like help booking accommodation, just let us know. :)

## The Anchorage

[The Anchorage](http://stradbrokeresorts.com.au/) has a minimum of 2 night stay. All units are self contained, and it has a fully fenced pool and direct access to the beach. You can even see the sea from some of the higher floors. The owners have let us know that the entire facility is booked out from Monday 9th February, so if you want to stay longer than this date, we recommend booking elsewhere. See [the PDF](http://stradbrokeresorts.com.au/Library/PDF'S/TARIFFS%202014%20-%202015.pdf) for information on the accommodation type and rates for the Anchorage.

## The Allure

[The Allure](http://www.stradbrokeresorts.com/) doesn't have direct beach access, but it is only 50m across the road! It is in a nice bush setting and also has an on-site pool and cafe on. 

These are the rates that have been provided to us (these include a 10% wedding discount):

## Other options

Other options include the [Manta Lodge and Dive Centre](http://www.mantalodge.com.au/), which is the backpackers and also short (10min) walk away, or if you're planning to stay for more than a few days, it might be worth renting a holiday house (or bach, as they're called in New Zealand).

## Final note - air conditioning
It has come to our attention that many accommodation options on the island do not have air conditioning. While it will be hot, especially by NZ standards, the island does get lovely bay breezes making it a few degrees cooler than the mainland, and most (if not all) places will have ceiling fans. If you think you might need air con though, we suggest checking with the accommodation when you make your booking :)
