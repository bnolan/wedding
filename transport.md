# Getting to Point Lookout

Even though we're getting married on a far away island (North Stradbroke Island) in a (sub)tropical sea, getting there shouldn't be too hard.

## Fly to Brisbane

If you're coming from NZ, we recommend flying to Brisbane on Thursday or Friday morning. It's a 3.5 hour flight from Wellington, a bit less from other places, a long way from Europe.

As our ceremony is later in the afternoon, you could also fly Saturday (the day of th wedding), and arrive early enough not to miss too much. You just might be a bit tired!

## Getting to Cleveland

We have suggested these flights allowing plenty of travel time to get to Pt Lookout during daylight hours, in time to go for a walk and get your bearings, have a swim or just relax in your room. Just keep in mind that the latest ferry from Cleveland (mainland) to the island is 7.25pm - so if you're arriving in the afternoon, you need to make sure there's enough time to clear the border and make your way to Cleveland to catch the ferry.

It's about a 40min drive (traffic dependent) from Brisbane airport to Cleveland, where the ferries for Straddie leave from. You can even take the train, if you're feeling adventurous and have lots of time (90-100min) - take the train to the city, change onto the Cleveland line (at Central or Roma St), then take the train right to the end - Cleveland. During daylight hours, there's a free shuttle bus from the Cleveland train station to the ferry terminal. This trip can take 90-100min. But if there is more than one of you arriving, it maybe cheaper and quicker to share a taxi (~$75).

If a bunch of you are arriving at around the same time, we will either organise a shuttle to take you from the airport to the ferry, or put you in touch with one another so you can share a taxi.

## Catching a ferry

To get to the island, you'll need to take a boat. We like to take the [Gold Cat](http://www.flyer.com.au/timetable-a-prices.html) ferry from Cleveland. You can also take the [Water Taxi](http://www.stradbrokeferries.com.au/timetables/water-taxi-timetable-north-stradbroke-island). Although they land at different places, you will still end up at Dunwich.

[How not to get to Straddie](http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/how-not-get-straddie/1307903/).

## On the Island

Once you arrive at Dunwich, take the bus that leaves right outside the ferry terminal. They meet both ferries [most of the time](http://www.northstradbrokeislandbuses.com/timetables.html) and it takes about 20min get to Pt Lookout and costs $5 (this is one way, and you will need cash). Ask the cruisey bus driver to be drop you off wherever you have booked to stay - the backpackers is the first stop, followed by the Anchorage, and the next is the Allure resort. Once you are at Pt Lookout, you can pretty much walk everywhere (or take the bus, which is $2 within Pt Lookout).

We will have a couple of cars on the island, so if for some reason you're arriving after dark (outside of bus hours), we will come pick you up from Dunwich - we'll just need to know in advance.

There are a few cafes, pubs &amp; a small 4Square Supermarket so you shouldn't starve while you are on the island. Plus we plan to feed you at least one night you are there.

# Going home

We are planning to stay on the island the week after the wedding, and any of you who wants to stay on with us are welcome. :)

But we know all good things must come to an end!

Getting off the island is pretty easy - it's just the same as getting there, but in reverse. 

Take the bus from Pt Lookout to Dunwich ($5), then get the water taxi back to Mainland. Then make your way from Cleveland to the airport - again, if there are a few of you, we will book a shuttle or plan to share a taxi. Or get the train!

We recommend booking your flight for later in the afternoon to leave plenty of time to get off the island and to the airport (especially for international flights). If you need to fly in the morning, you will most likely need to overnight in Brisbane in order to get to the airport in time.
